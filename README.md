<h1 align="center">ðŸ”¹ðŸ”· VgameStore ðŸ”·ðŸ”¹</h1>

<p align="justify">This is the final project for the Web Application Development course at IES Laguna de Joatzel, Getafe, Madrid.</p>

---

The project consists of a fictional game store, where users can log in, search for games, add them to their wishlists, "buy" them, add them to their libraries and (possibly) download files. It's available in English (and maybe Spanish).

There are other users (administrators) that can create games; adding their title, description, developer, publisher, release date, images to showcase and a file that will be the one that users download after "buying" the game.
