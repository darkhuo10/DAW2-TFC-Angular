  The project consists of a fictional game store, where users can log in, search for games, add them to their wishlists, "buy" them, add them to their libraries and (possibly) download files. It's available in English (and maybe Spanish).

  There are other users (administrators) that can create games; adding their title, description, developer, publisher, release date, images to showcase and a file that will be the one that users download after "buying" the game.

  Each game has an image (or more than  one) plus basic info about itself. In addition, games can have reviews that will also be shown on the game's page.
